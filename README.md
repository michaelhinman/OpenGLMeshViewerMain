Utilizes additional classes and utils to read object files and build trimeshes 
from command line, scale models to fit within a unit cube, centered at the origin.  
Calculates offset and scaling based upon the number of models and centers them
inside a 2 unit cube at the origin.  Utilizes keyboard callbacks for camera movement,
rotation via mouse input x & y, and reset view (spacebar).
